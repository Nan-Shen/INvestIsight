# INvestInsight

## How it works

The INvestInsight Crew is composed of multiple AI agents, each with unique roles, goals, and tools. These agents collaborate on a series of tasks, leveraging their collective skills to achieve complex objectives. Here's how it works:

    ðŸ§­ Planner Agent â€“ Breaks down complex objectives into actionable steps.

    ðŸ”„ ReAct Agents â€“ Each step is handled by a ReAct agent equipped with web search and scraping tools.

    âœ… Evaluator Agent â€“ Verifies and ensures the accuracy and coherence of the outputs.

    ðŸ‘¤ Human-in-the-Loop â€“ Users can interact during the planning and evaluation phases to maintain relevance and domain alignment.
